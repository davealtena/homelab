# Introduction

I have installed most components of the Prometheus/Grafana stack for observability.

## Grafana
Open Source Monitoring

## kube-prometheus-stack

## node-exporter
Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.
